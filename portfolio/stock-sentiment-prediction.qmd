description: This project focuses on optimizing the predictive capabilities of modern RNN models for stock price movements of TSLA, AAPL, and GOOG. The goal is to enhance forecasting accuracy by utilizing historical stock data and news sentiment data. The analysis evaluates the performance of LSTM, GRU, and Attention-CNN-LSTM models, tested with and without sentiment data, to determine their effectiveness in stock price prediction.
